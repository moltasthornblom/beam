# Beam - A Lightweight VoD Streaming Service

Beam is a lightweight Video on Demand (VoD) streaming service designed to provide a seamless experience for uploading and streaming videos. This project is open-source and can be easily deployed using Docker Compose.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login using JWT-based authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign specific permissions to different user roles (Admin, Uploader, Viewer).
- **Video Management**: Upload videos and convert them into multiple resolutions for adaptive streaming.
- **HLS Streaming**: Deliver videos using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) for adaptive bitrate streaming.
- **4K Video Support**: Out of the box support for uploading and streaming 4K videos.
- **API Documentation**: Detailed API documentation available through Swagger.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect endpoints from excessive requests with rate limiting.
- **Security**: Enhanced security features with Helmet and CORS.
- **Request Validation**: Validate incoming requests using Joi schemas to ensure data integrity.

## Quick Start

To quickly start the application using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Set up the necessary environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file or a `.env` file. Refer to the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details.
3. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file from this repository.
4. Run the following command in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This will pull the necessary Docker image from Docker Hub and start the application.

## Environment Variables
